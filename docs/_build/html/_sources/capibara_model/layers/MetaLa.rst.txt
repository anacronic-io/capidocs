MetaLACapibaraLayer
===================

The `MetaLACapibaraLayer` is an attention layer with dynamic decay, self-augmentation, and sparsity. It is implemented using the JAX and Haiku libraries.

Parameters
----------

- `dim` (int): Dimension of the embedding space.
- `heads` (int): Number of attention heads. Default is 8.
- `dim_head` (int): Dimension of each attention head. Default is 64.
- `sparsity` (float): Fraction of weights to set to zero (e.g., 0.5 for 50% sparsity).
- `name` (str): Name of the layer. Default is None.

Initialization
--------------

The layer is initialized with the following parameters:

- `alpha`: Parameter for dynamic decay, initialized as a constant value of 1.0 with shape (heads, dim_head).
- `self_aug_param`: Parameter for self-augmentation, initialized using a random normal distribution with shape (1, heads, dim_head).

Forward Computation
-------------------

The forward computation of the `MetaLACapibaraLayer` involves the following steps:

1. Obtain query (Q) and value (V) matrices using linear transformations.
2. Split Q and V into multiple heads.
3. Apply sparsity to Q and V by randomly setting a fraction of weights to zero based on the `sparsity` parameter.
4. Calculate dynamic decay (Î›) for each step in the sequence using a sigmoid function.
5. Apply decay and accumulate state for each token using `jax.lax.scan`.
6. Perform self-augmentation by combining the query matrix with the self-augmentation parameter using a sigmoid function.
7. Combine the self-augmented query matrix with the decayed states.
8. Reshape the output and apply a final linear transformation.

The output tensor has the same shape as the input tensor: (batch, seq_len, dim).

Configuration
-------------

The `get_config` method returns a dictionary containing the layer's configuration, including the `dim`, `heads`, `dim_head`, and `sparsity` parameters.

Logging
-------

The layer uses the `logging` module to log information about the applied sparsity. The logging level is set to `INFO`, and the log messages include the timestamp, module name, log level, and message.

Dependencies
------------

The `MetaLACapibaraLayer` depends on the following libraries:

- JAX: `jax` and `jax.numpy` for numerical operations and random number generation.
- Haiku: `haiku` for building and managing the layer's parameters and modules.
- Optax: `optax` for optimization utilities.

Note: The `# type: ignore` comments are used to suppress type checking for the imported libraries.
