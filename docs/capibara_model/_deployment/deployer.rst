Deployer
========

The Deployer module is responsible for managing the deployment of the CapibaraGPT model in production environments. This module provides tools and utilities to facilitate the implementation, scaling, and monitoring of the model across different platforms.

Key Features
------------

- Automated deployment on multiple platforms (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)
- Model version management
- Automatic scaling based on demand
- Model performance monitoring and logging
- Integration with CI/CD systems

Main Classes
------------

   :show-inheritance:

Utility Functions
-----------------

.. autofunction:: deployment.deployer.prepare_model_for_deployment

.. autofunction:: deployment.deployer.validate_deployment_config

Deployment Configuration
------------------------

Deployment configuration is done through a YAML file. Here's an example configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

   deployment:
     platform: aws
     instance_type: ml.c5.xlarge
     min_instances: 2
     max_instances: 10
     auto_scaling:
       metric: cpu_utilization
       target_value: 70
     model_version: v1.0.9
     environment:
       CAPIBARA_MAX_LENGTH: 512
       CAPIBARA_BATCH_SIZE: 32

Deployment Process
------------------

1. Model Preparation
   - Export the trained model
   - Optimize for inference

2. Environment Configuration
   - Select the deployment platform
   - Configure environment variables

3. Deployment
   - Load the model onto the selected platform
   - Start necessary services

4. Monitoring and Maintenance
   - Set up alerts
   - Perform updates and rollbacks as needed

Usage Example
-------------

.. code-block:: python

   from deployment.deployer import ModelDeployer, CloudProvider

   # Initialize the deployer
   deployer = ModelDeployer(CloudProvider.AWS)

   # Configure the deployment
   deployer.configure(config_path='deployment_config.yaml')

   # Perform the deployment
   deployment_id = deployer.deploy()

   # Monitor the deployment
   status = deployer.get_deployment_status(deployment_id)
   print(f"Deployment status: {status}")

Security Considerations
-----------------------

- Use secure credentials and rotate them regularly
- Implement encryption in transit and at rest
- Configure firewalls and security groups appropriately
- Conduct periodic security audits

For more details on implementation and deployment best practices, please refer to the complete documentation of the Deployer module.
