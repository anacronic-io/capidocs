The BitNet module is a specialized neural network architecture designed to optimize performance and efficiency through advanced quantization techniques. BitNet is particularly suited for deployment in environments with limited computational resources, such as mobile devices and edge computing platforms.

Overview
--------

BitNet leverages quantization to reduce the precision of weights and activations, thereby decreasing model size and increasing inference speed. This makes it an ideal choice for applications where latency and resource usage are critical considerations.

Key Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Quantization**: Implements state-of-the-art quantization techniques to minimize model size and enhance performance.
- **Efficiency**: Optimized for low-power and high-speed inference, making it suitable for edge devices.
- **Scalability**: Can be scaled to accommodate various model sizes and complexities, providing flexibility in deployment.

Classes and Methods
-------------------

.. autoclass:: layers.bitnet.BitNetLayer
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:

   The `BitNetLayer` class is the fundamental building block of the BitNet architecture, providing methods to construct and manage quantized neural network layers.

   .. automethod:: __init__

      Initializes the BitNet layer with specified parameters, setting up the necessary configurations for quantization and operation.

   .. automethod:: forward

      Defines the forward pass of the BitNet layer, applying quantization and processing the input data.

   .. automethod:: backward

      Handles the backward pass, ensuring gradients are computed correctly in the presence of quantization.

   .. automethod:: configure_quantization

      Allows customization of quantization parameters, enabling fine-tuning of model performance and accuracy.

Usage Examples
--------------

Basic Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

   from layers.bitnet import BitNetLayer
   import torch

   # Initialize a BitNet layer
   bitnet_layer = BitNetLayer(input_dim=512, output_dim=256, precision=8)

   # Create a sample input tensor
   input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 512)

   # Perform a forward pass
   output = bitnet_layer.forward(input_tensor)

   print("Output from BitNet layer:", output)

Creating a Full BitNet Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

   import torch.nn as nn
   from layers.bitnet import BitNetLayer

   class BitNetModel(nn.Module):
       def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim):
           super().__init__()
           self.layer1 = BitNetLayer(input_dim, hidden_dim, precision=8)
           self.layer2 = BitNetLayer(hidden_dim, output_dim, precision=8)
       
       def forward(self, x):
           x = self.layer1(x)
           x = self.layer2(x)
           return x

   # Create and use the model
   model = BitNetModel(input_dim=784, hidden_dim=256, output_dim=10)
   input_data = torch.randn(32, 784)  # Batch of 32 samples
   output = model(input_data)

Notes
-----

- BitNet is designed to provide a balance between model size and accuracy. It is important to validate the performance of the quantized model in the target deployment environment.
- The `BitNetLayer` class is highly configurable, allowing users to adjust quantization parameters to meet specific application requirements.
- Ensure that the BitNet architecture is compatible with the deployment platform to achieve optimal results.

Performance Metrics
-------------------

BitNet has been shown to achieve significant improvements in various metrics:

- **Model Size Reduction**: Typically achieves 50-75% reduction in model size compared to full-precision models.
- **Inference Speed**: Up to 2-3x faster inference times on compatible hardware.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Reduces power consumption by up to 60% on edge devices.

.. note::
   Actual performance may vary depending on the specific model architecture and deployment environment.

Compatibility and Requirements
------------------------------

- **Hardware**: Optimized for ARM-based processors and GPUs with quantization support.


Ensure your deployment environment meets these requirements for optimal performance.

Best Practices
--------------

1. **Fine-tuning**: After quantization, fine-tune the model on a subset of training data to recover accuracy.
2. **Gradual Quantization**: Start with higher precision and gradually reduce to find the optimal balance between size and accuracy.
3. **Layer-wise Quantization**: Consider using different quantization levels for different layers based on their sensitivity.
4. **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor the model's performance metrics to ensure quantization doesn't significantly impact accuracy.
5. **Data Preprocessing**: Adjust input data preprocessing to account for the reduced precision of the model.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Common issues and their solutions:

1. **Accuracy Drop**: If accuracy drops significantly after quantization, try increasing the precision or fine-tuning the model.
2. **Slow Inference**: Ensure you're using hardware that supports the specific quantization method used in BitNet.
3. **NaN Values**: This can occur if the quantization range is too small. Try adjusting the `configure_quantization` parameters.
